##### FM(Factorization Machine)
- This script focuses on using machine learning for predictive analytics for recommendation purposes. Initially, it downloads the MovieLens dataset, processes it to extract and restructure genre information, and joins it with movie ratings. The script also discusses uploading the processed data to a cloud environment (specifics involve AWS Sagemaker), preparing the data in a format suitable for use with a Factorization Machine model via AWS.
- It demonstrates handling categorical data by converting genres into one-hot encoded format and merges this with other movie details. The script includes functionalities to serialize the processed data for model consumption, and demonstrates how to interact with a cloud-based machine learning model to perform predictions.
