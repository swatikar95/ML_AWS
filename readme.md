##### Data Cleansing
- `missing_value_depedent_data`: This script uses the Iris dataset to demonstrate how to handle missing values that are dependent on other variables. It first identifies the presence of missing values, calculates the number of missing values per column, and then fills these missing values with the mean of the corresponding class.
- `missing_value_timeseries`: This script handles missing values in a time-series dataset using different approaches: Dropping, Filling with zero, Replacing with mean, Interpolating, Forward filling, Backward filling.
- `missing_values_independent_data`: This script deals with missing data in a dataset where the missing values are independent of other variables (VehicleTrafficRoads.csv). It simply drops rows with missing values, under the assumption that the missing data does not impact other observations.
##### FM(Factorization Machine)
- This script focuses on using machine learning for predictive analytics for recommendation purposes. Initially, it downloads the MovieLens dataset, processes it to extract and restructure genre information, and joins it with movie ratings. The script also discusses uploading the processed data to a cloud environment (specifics involve AWS Sagemaker), preparing the data in a format suitable for use with a Factorization Machine model via AWS.
- It demonstrates handling categorical data by converting genres into one-hot encoded format and merges this with other movie details. The script includes functionalities to serialize the processed data for model consumption, and demonstrates how to interact with a cloud-based machine learning model to perform predictions.
##### Model Evaluation
- `binary_classifier`: This script uses binary classification models. It plots actual vs. predicted results for each model and calculates the classification report and confusion matrix for each model. 
- `multiclass_classifier`: This script appears to handle a dataset with multiple classes, plotting actual vs. predicted results from multiple models. It evaluates the performance of these models using a confusion matrix and classification reports, providing both count and ratio (normalized) views for the confusion matrices. This approach is particularly useful for understanding how well each model performs across different classes, helping to diagnose issues like class imbalance.
- `regression`: This script deals with evaluating regression models using an air passenger sample dataset. It visualizes the actual vs. predicted number of passengers for multiple models and calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for each. Such metrics are crucial for quantifying the performance of regression models, indicating how closely the predicted values match the actual numbers.
##### PCA(Principal Component Analysis)
- This script applies PCA to reduce the dimensionality of a bike rental dataset, facilitating more efficient data analysis and machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, the execution of PCA with Scikit-learn, and visualizations of the results to assess the variance captured by the principal components.
##### XGBoost
- `iris_classification`:  This script prepares the Iris dataset for machine learning tasks. It begins by encoding the class labels (species) into integers, demonstrating basic data preprocessing steps necessary for many machine learning models. It then visualizes the relationship between petal length and sepal length for each species, providing a graphical representation that will help in understanding feature distributions. Then it trains an XGBoost model in a cloud environment.
- `mashroom_classification`: This script uses XGBoost for a binary classification task on mushroom data (edible or poisonous). It involves detailed preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables and setting up training and validation datasets. The script evaluates the model using log loss during training and shows the importance of features in the dataset, which helps in understanding which attributes most significantly influence the prediction of whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.
